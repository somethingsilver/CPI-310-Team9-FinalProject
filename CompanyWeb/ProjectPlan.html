<p>NextWave Collection is your one-stop-shop when it comes to finding and reviewing indie content. We want to create a community that helps promote indie marvels that may not see as much popularity as some of the big name big budget studios as well as help content consumers find it.

<br>

<br>By creating our database, users are easily able to find new content suggestions each week and are asked to review them if consumed. This helps both people find exactly what they didn't know they were looking for as well as giving the creators real time feedback on their work.</p>
