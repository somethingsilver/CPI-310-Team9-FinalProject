Ajani Sanders:
<br> 
What's up everybody!
 I'm Ajani Sanders and am currently a Junior in the Ira A.  Fulton schools of engineering. I study Computer Informatics  with an emphasis in enterprise. I’m from San Diego, CA and I enjoy the beach scenery in my free time.  I'm a fan of many shows(Cobra Kai), arts(Renaissance art), movies(Inception), music types(Rap, Rock, etc.), and sports! I enjoy coding with really doing frontend work but am starting to learn more of the backend work. Favorite hobbies are drawing, playing video games, and learning how to mod games on my PC.
